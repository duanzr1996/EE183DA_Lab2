# EE183DA_Lab2

This is Lab assignment 2 for EE 183DA. In this lab, I use web interface to control the servo to create "music".

•	Bill of Materials:
I used a FS90 Servo to control the arm to hit the bottles in different rhythms, therefore creating percussion music; the arm is made of cardboard and a metal screwdriver bit is attached on the front of the arm.

•	Schematics

•	Wiring Setup
The servo has three wire inputs: data, voltage and ground. I plugged them on number 4 of the motor driver shield.
